## Description

This was a fun one to find. First found a reference in Flora (2017) to Ullman (2007),
which was a chapter in Tabachnick and Fidell (6th ed, 2013). The chapter, however, got
data from a "grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (#DA 00847) to L. S. Fidell 
and J. E. Prather in 1974–1976". Data were finally found to have been used in Hoffman
and Fidell (1979). 

## Reference

Data from:

  Hoffman, D., & Fidell, L. S. (1979). Characteristics

Variable descriptions from (and summary of methods/measures can be found in):
